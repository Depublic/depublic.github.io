What if the world would come to an end?
What if our souls have drifted apart?
What if a war would break out again?
What if we go right back to the start?

And now I see you breaking down
Won't let you feel like this

Whatever makes us stronger
whatever I can get
please stay here a little longer
and tell me what's ahead

What if they find hope a kind of a weakness?
What if the sky comes tumbling down?
What if they reveal all the secrets?
What if they burn our homes to the ground?

Let's put our strength together now
so we can catch our break

Whatever makes us stronger
whatever I can get
please stay here a little longer
and tell me what's ahead

Whatever makes us stronger
whatever I can get
please stay here a little longer
and tell me what's ahead
