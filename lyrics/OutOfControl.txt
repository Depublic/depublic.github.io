A lot of times I feel like
I will burst out into flames
from exploding up inside my head 
a heavy load is on my brain

The world is moving quickly
and the pace is way too fast
but I will do the very best I can
I will do my best to last

Don't you know that were racing
to be the best at everything
Don't you know that life goes on
completely out of control?

It's a question of survival
and the richest will survive
We've arrived at the point where
We're out of control

We're out of control
We're out of control right now 
We're out of control



Politics and justice
are just words I don't believe

because the gain of wealth and power is
what we´re trying to achieve

Simply try and take it easy
and you will find some peace of mind

'cause noone will define you if
you will lose or fall behind 


Don't you know that were racing
to be the best at everything
Don't you know that life goes on
completely out of control?

It's a question of survival
and the richest will survive
We've arrived at the point where
We're out of control

We're out of control
We're out of control right now 
We're out of control

(Now it seems like we're loosing it, no control)
Out of control
(Now it seems like we're loosing it, no control)

Are we out of control?
(Now it seems like we're loosing it, no control)
Out of control
(Now it seems like we're loosing it, no control)
No control
