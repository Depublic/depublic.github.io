Still I chase my goblins
Still I hide from sorrow
Still I run from love
Still I fear tomorrow


Holding me down, holding me back from breaking out

Figuring out what I'm tryin' to find
but I feel so lost


I feel so alone 7 days a week

For all my mistakes, I can't fall asleep
For your whisper echoes in my head (echoes in my head)
all the 7 days a week

Still I am so useless
Because I feel so helpless
Still I hate my dreams
They end up all as nightmares

Holding me down, holding me back from breaking out
Figuring out what I'm tryin' to find 
but I feel so lost


I feel so alone 7 days a week

For all my mistakes, I can't fall asleep
For your whisper echoes in my head (echoes in my head)
all the 7 days a week

Asking, begging, for something I am hoping to find

Wanting, needing, a place to rest and clear my mind

Looking, seeking, for someone that can set me free
Knowing that I'm looking for more 
but I feel so lost 

I feel so alone, 7 days a week

For all my mistakes, I can't fall asleep
For your whisper echoes in my head (echoes in my head)
all the 7 days a week

7 days a week
7 days a week
I can't fall asleep
