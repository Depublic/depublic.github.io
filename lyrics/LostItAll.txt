The infiltrated, humble glory
and egocentric state of mind
have altered a perceptive story
known to us and all mankind

A chapter that will end in sorrow
disaster will regain control
unless we make a change tomorrow
and hope that someone saves our souls

I've lost it all, yeahh I lost myself
I've lost it all!

A need to fix our situation
and balance out the energy
faces future generations
that strive to find a remedy

If hope is lost and love abandoned
in destructive synergies
we might as well give up and deliver
the victory to the enemy

I've lost it all, yeahh I lost myself
I've lost it all!
I've lost it all, yeahh I lost myself
I've lost it all!

I can feel everything that's been slippin' away
I can feel the love that's fadin' out
Tryin' to fix all the things that are coming my way
But I fear they're lost

I can feel everything that's been slippin' away
I can feel the love that's fadin' out
Tryin' to fix all the things that are coming my way
But I fear they're lost

I've lost it all, yeahh I lost myself
I've lost it all!
I've lost it all, yeahh I lost myself
I've lost it all!
