You try to play this fateful game
change your looks and change your name
You want to fool me in deceipt
I turn my back that's your defeat

You may think you're just like God
You lie to cheat, you know you're fraud
Put the mask on that's devine

diminish everything that's mine

Put your mask aside
and show me that you're true

you know it's true, I know it's true, there are bridges you have burned
I gave it all, it's just for you, but you need change because you've learned
you know it's true, I know it's true, noone's standing by your throne
I gave it all, it's just for you, but now you're playing on your own

I see deception in your eyes
and even see through all your lies
soon you'll start to realize
Defeat will come as no surprise

Turn your back is what you do
it's easier than facing the rules
I've given up cause you don't change
Now you're alone and that's your pain

Put your mask back on
Cause now I want you gone

you know it's true, I know it's true, there are bridges you have burned
I gave it all, it's just for you, but you need change because you've learned
you know it's true, I know it's true, noone's standing by your throne
I gave it all, it's just for you, but now you're playing on your own




It's fake what you feel

This can't be real

All the emotions you conceal


Open your eyes

and stop all these lies

at least feel the life before you die


I won't let this slide

I won't let you hide

I won't let it tear you up inside


You won't let it show

you won't let it go

You don't bother, NO NO NO!



you know it's true, I know it's true, there are bridges you have burned
I gave it all, it's just for you, but you need change because you've learned
you know it's true, I know it's true, noone's standing by your throne
I gave it all, it's just for you, but now you're playing on your own
