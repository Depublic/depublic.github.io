On a winter night it's getting cold and dark
she starts to walk back home out through the empty park
Now she's being chased and she tries to escape
She fears the danger of being...

If I scream will it stop him? Let me be, 
rescue me, I'm dying!
My dreams have shattered to pieces, 
look at me! 
Reality, 
I'm dying
!

She feels her fate 
is loosing sanity
as she sees her breath 
is lighting up the sky
She feels her eyes 
are filling up with tears
He holds her tight and doesn't let her...


If I scream will it stop him? Let me be, 
rescue me, I'm dying!

My dreams have shattered to pieces, 
look at me! 
Reality, 
I'm dying!

To feel the ungrateful look of rage
noone can help me
a sound of a teardrop in the darkest night
echoes in silence



If I scream will it stop him? Let me be, 
rescue me, I'm dying!
My dreams have shattered to pieces, 
look at me! 
Reality, 
I'm dying!


You justify pleasure in a way that's powerful

This action is forever 
saved in my memory

A personality 
you can't excuse yourself

I'm completely deceived


I'm dying
I'm dying!
