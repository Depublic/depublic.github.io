The clock is ringing and you jump up from your bed
you put some whiskey in your coffee just to fix your head
The traffic's slow and the rain is pouring down
hit the gas, racing time you want to get out of town
..want to get out of town
..you want to get out of town

Slow down!
Time just isn't worth it
would you rather live or die?
Slow down!
You think you will be happy
If you get there on time?

Turn on your speakers and light your cigarette
talk on your phone and the drive ain't in your head
The road is slick and the car is out of control
you start to slide and off that road you go
..off that road you go
..off that road you go

Slow down!
Time just isn't worth it
would you rather live or die?
Slow down!
You think you will be happy
If you get there on time?

On time, on time, on time
You just want to get there on time

Slow down!
Time just isn't worth it
would you rather live or die?
Slow down!
You think you will be happy
If you get there on time?

Slow down! Slow down!
Slow down! Slow down!
Slow down! Slow down!
Slow down! Slow down!
