You rock my world when you slow...
down your dance
I taste your kiss as you blow...
me away
And when you move your body re...
minds me of
a memory of the hottest breeze...
I ever felt

Feel me, touch me, tie me down!

You ride me fast, you ride me hard...
turn me on
oh how it feels and how you look...
carry on
you're on the clock, 5 minutes left...
wrap it up
Now time is up so you get dressed...
here's your payment

Feel me, touch me, tie me down!

I can feel you baby 
Now I want you
I can breathe you baby 
I can taste you baby
Now I love you....
song is done!

Play with me!
