I won't forget your face
till the day I die
I can remember everything
that you helped me through

Now I've become a better man
because you gave me strength
to carry on without regrets and
to never look back

You're the one I used to follow
Everyday I miss you more and more
They used to call me your shadow
and they still 
call me by that name.

The memory of you
lights me up inside
This memory means everything
it makes me carry on

Now, there's a time that I remember
A time where I was blessed
Because I got the chance to get to know
the man that you were

You're the one I used to follow
Everyday I, miss you more and more
They used to call me your shadow
and they still, call me by that name

I won't forget your face
till the day I die

Breathe into my lifeline, I know that you are here with me
Breathe into my lifeline, I know that you are here with me
You are here with me

You're the one I used to follow
Everyday I, miss you more and more
They used to call me your shadow
and they still, call me by that name!
