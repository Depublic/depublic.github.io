So, we've started,
once again we fall apart.
It seems
you have figured it out.

We weren't meant to be
although we stayed true
until you found I had broken...

the promise I made to you
the promise I made to you

Now it's over,
we part in separate ways.
It feels
like it's been over for ages.

How did we get to here?
Where did we go wrong?
It's likely all my fault, I broke...

the promise I made to you
the promise I made to you
the promise I made to you
the promise I made to you

No reason
to keep holding on.
No reason
to keep holding on.
Keep holding on...

the promise I made to you
the promise I made to you
the promise I made to you
the promise I made to you!
