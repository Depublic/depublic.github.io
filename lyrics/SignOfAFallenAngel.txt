I am your blood before your born
I am your panic when you're torn
I am the silence in your head
I am your voice when you must speak
I am your second choice instead
I am the happiness you seek

I'm all alone, now I'm all alone
I'm all alone, now I'm all alone

Sign of an angel looking down
I feel you falling to the ground
vital signs are dropping, fading out so I become alone
 
You leave me cold
I will live on
in silence
in the end I'm living on my own

I am your rage, your self esteem
I am the nightmare in your dream
I am your strength when you are down
I am the feeling of despair
I am your noise when your silence drowns
I am the tool of self-repair

I'm all alone, now I'm all alone
I'm all alone, now I'm all alone

Sign of an angel looking down
I feel you falling to the ground
vital signs are dropping, fading out so I become alone
 
You leave me cold
I will live on
in silence
in the end I'm living on my own

Sign of an angel looking down
I feel you falling to the ground
vital signs are dropping, fading out

When it's time for you to go
I will live on
Emptiness! You leave me cold
I am alone

I'm all alone, now I'm all alone
I'm all alone, now I'm all alone
I'm all alone, now I'm all alone
I'm all alone, now I'm all alone
