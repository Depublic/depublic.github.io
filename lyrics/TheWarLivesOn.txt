Why is the world so aggressive?

When we don't know what we are fighting for

Homicide, suicide, tooth for tooth and eye for eye

eye for eye

eye for eye

eye for eye 




The innocent will die

The Gods above will cry

while the guilty remain alive


There's nothing we can do

and all of this is true

the war lives on



A battle! Who has the most power?

and who will gain the most from indifference

now it's clear, what I fear, what is lost is what I hold so dear

hold so dear

hold so dear 

hold so dear

The innocent will die

The Gods above will cry

while the guilty remain alive


There's nothing we can do

and all of this is true

the war lives on






If we don't settle on a solution

for all this madness and insanity

We will die, you will see, the end is here and it is killing me

killing me

killing me

killing me
killing me


The innocent will die

The Gods above will cry

while the guilty remain alive


There's nothing we can do

and all of this is true

the war lives on
the war lives on

the war lives on
