
The will to change yourself is gone
stone cold
And all these things that you've done wrong
I fold
It seems to me that you've become
hollow
You leave me now I sure as hell won't
follow

I am ending
What you started
I am fed up
I am angry 
Let me go
Fuck what you said now and fuck what you did
I don't care, 
I'm fed up! 

As soon as I become so cold
inside
you're begging me to come back home
tonight
You've had your chances they were all
mistakes
'cause every time you seemed to fail and my
heart ached

I am ending
what you started
I am fed up
I am angry
Let me go
Fuck what you said now and fuck what you did
I don't care, 
I'm fed up!
Let me go
My patience is gone, won't you leave me alone
I am done, 
I'm fed up!


Still angry now
so angry
I'm furious
I'm angry

Still angry now
so angry
I'm furious
I'm angry

Still angry now
so angry
I'm furious
I'm angry

Still angry now
so angry
I'm furious
I'm angry
